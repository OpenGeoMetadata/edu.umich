These data are supplemented by personal aneroid determinations both in Indiana and Ohio, and by notes furnished by members of the Indiana Survey. In Eastern Ohio available data are sufficient to map only the main areas standing above 1,000 feet, and are insufficient to supply other contours.\"|\"J. Ottmann Lith. Co., Puck Bldg. N.Y.\"",
