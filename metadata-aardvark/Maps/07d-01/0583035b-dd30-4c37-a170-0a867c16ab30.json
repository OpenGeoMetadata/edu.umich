    "Relief shown pictorially. Ships and a sea monster are in the ocean. The scale cartouche includes fruit and a face, while the title caroutche includes two fish on the bottom, a woman on the left holding a snake, and an angel on the right holding a chalice and a cross. Does not match any states in Van der Krogt due to the lack of text on the verso. From the Jansson Appendix Atlas 1636-1680, title created to represent a unique collection within the Clark Library, University of Michigan. 1 map; 37 x 47 cm. This map is in the public domain.
